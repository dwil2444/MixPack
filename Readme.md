# MixPack


MixPack is an event driven web-based DJ Controller Emulator.

Load a song onto a deck by dragging an mp3 file over either of the vinyl images.

In order to interact with a deck, that deck must be active.
By default when the browser is opened, the left deck is active. Press the 'w' key
to switch between active decks.

To play a song loaded onto an active deck, press the 'p' key. To stop an active song,
press the 's' key. Use the crossfader between the two decks to mix songs. Use the volume
buttons adjacent to both decks to adjust the respective volume of each deck.

Enjoy!
